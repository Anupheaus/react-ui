# Calendar

A full-page calendar component with month, week, and day views. It renders a list of `CalendarEntryRecord` items and supports entry selection. The month view shows a traditional grid; the week view shows a timed schedule across configurable weekdays; the day view shows a timed schedule for a single day.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `view` | `'month' \| 'week' \| 'day'` | No | Which view to render (default: `'month'`). |
| `viewingDate` | `Date` | No | The date the calendar is currently showing (default: today). |
| `entries` | `readonly CalendarEntryRecord[]` | No | Array of calendar entries to display. |
| `onSelect` | `(entry: CalendarEntryRecord) => void` | No | Called when the user selects an entry. |
| `label` | `ReactNode` | No | Optional label shown above the view (month, week, and day). |
| `className` | `string` | No | CSS class applied to the root element. |

### Week-view-only props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `weekDays` | `readonly CalendarWeekDay[]` | No | Weekdays to show as columns (default: Mon–Sun). |
| `startHour` | `number` | No | First hour shown in the week view (0–23). |
| `endHour` | `number` | No | Last hour shown in the week view (0–23). |
| `hourHeight` | `number` | No | Pixel height of each hour row in the week view. |

### Day-view-only props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `startHour` | `number` | No | First hour shown in the day view (0–23). |
| `endHour` | `number` | No | Last hour shown in the day view (0–23). |
| `hourHeight` | `number` | No | Pixel height of each hour row in the day view. |

## CalendarWeekDay

```ts
type CalendarWeekDay = 'mon' | 'tue' | 'wed' | 'thu' | 'fri' | 'sat' | 'sun';

const DEFAULT_CALENDAR_WEEK_DAYS: readonly CalendarWeekDay[] = [
  'mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat', 'sun',
];
```

## CalendarEntryRecord

```ts
interface CalendarEntryRecord {
  id: string;
  startDate: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  isAllDay?: boolean;
  isBusy?: boolean;
  title?: ReactNode;          // omit or pass '' while loading; Typography shows a random-width skeleton
  description?: ReactNode;
  color?: string;           // hex/CSS colour used to tint the entry chip
  icon?: IconName;          // icon shown inside the entry chip
}
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Calendar, CalendarEntryRecord } from '@anupheaus/react-ui';

const entries: CalendarEntryRecord[] = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Team Stand-up',
    startDate: new Date('2025-06-10T09:00:00'),
    endDate: new Date('2025-06-10T09:30:00'),
    color: '#9ADDFB',
    icon: 'calendar',
  },
];

function MyCalendar() {
  return (
    <Calendar
      entries={entries}
      viewingDate={new Date()}
      onSelect={entry => console.log('selected', entry)}
    />
  );
}

// Week view (Mon–Sun by default)
function MyWeekCalendar() {
  return (
    <Calendar
      view="week"
      viewingDate={new Date()}
      entries={entries}
      startHour={8}
      endHour={18}
      onSelect={entry => console.log('selected', entry)}
    />
  );
}

// Week view with selected weekdays only
function MyWorkWeekCalendar() {
  return (
    <Calendar
      view="week"
      weekDays={['mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri']}
      viewingDate={new Date()}
      entries={entries}
    />
  );
}

// Day view
function MyDayCalendar() {
  return (
    <Calendar
      view="day"
      viewingDate={new Date()}
      entries={entries}
      startHour={8}
      endHour={18}
      hourHeight={60}
    />
  );
}
```

## Architecture

`Calendar` wraps its content in two context providers — `CalendarEntrySelectionProvider` and `CalendarEntryHighlightProvider` — so that child views can coordinate hover/selection state without prop-drilling. The actual rendering is delegated to `CalendarMonthView`, `CalendarWeekView`, or `CalendarDayView` depending on the `view` prop.

## Decision rationale

**Two separate context providers for selection and highlight**

`CalendarEntrySelectionProvider` tracks which entry is selected (a persistent click-based state), while `CalendarEntryHighlightProvider` tracks which entry is hovered (transient pointer-based state). Keeping them separate prevents a hover on one entry from re-rendering every component subscribed to selection state. In the month view, each cell subscribes to highlight state for its own entries — if selection and highlight shared one context, hovering any entry would re-render every cell.

## Ambiguities and gotchas

- **`view` defaults to `'month'`** — omitting the `view` prop renders the month grid. Pass `view="week"` or `view="day"` explicitly for schedule views.
- **`viewingDate` defaults to today** — all views use `viewingDate` to determine which month/week/day to show. Updating `viewingDate` is the only way to navigate; there are no built-in prev/next controls.
- **Week view uses Monday-start weeks** — the week containing `viewingDate` is resolved from Monday through Sunday unless `weekDays` limits the visible columns.
- **Schedule props are ignored in month view** — `weekDays`, `startHour`, `endHour`, and `hourHeight` are only read by the week and day views.
