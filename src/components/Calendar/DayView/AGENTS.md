# CalendarDayView

The timed-schedule day view for the `Calendar` component. Renders entries as positioned chips on a scrollable hour grid for a single day.

## Overview

`CalendarDayView` is selected when `Calendar` is rendered with `view="day"`. It shows a vertical scrollable area with hour labels on the left and entry chips positioned absolutely over the hours. The visible hour range auto-expands to include all entries even if they fall outside the `startHour`/`endHour` props.

## Contents

### Components
- `CalendarDayView.tsx` — root component. Computes the effective `startHour`/`endHour` range (expanding to fit entries), calculates the initial `scrollTo` offset to centre the `viewingDate`'s current time, and composes `CalendarDayViewHours` and `CalendarDayViewEntries` inside a `Scroller`.
- `CalendarDayViewHours.tsx` — the left-hand hour label column. Renders one row per hour between `startHour` and `endHour`, each `hourHeight` pixels tall.
- `CalendarDayViewEntries.tsx` — the entries overlay. Positions each `CalendarEntryRecord` absolutely based on its `startDate` time relative to `startHour` and `hourHeight`. Handles overlapping entries by splitting available width. Entry titles are rendered with `Typography` (`disableGrow`) so empty titles show random-width skeleton bars at text height while loading.

### Utilities
- `CalendarDayUtils.ts` — pure time-to-pixel conversion helpers:
  - `getOffset(date, hourHeight, startHour)` — returns the pixel Y offset from the top of the hour grid for a given time
  - `getHeight(entry, hourHeight)` — pixel height of an entry chip based on its duration
  - `getMinutes(date)` — total minutes from midnight

## Ambiguities and gotchas

- **`startHour`/`endHour` are treated as hints, not hard limits** — if any entry's start or end time falls outside the provided range, the range is silently expanded to include it. The provided values are only used when no entries fall outside them.
- **`scrollTo` is computed from `calendarDayViewElementRef.current`** — this is a `useMemo` that reads a DOM element. The initial value is `0` because the ref is not yet populated on the first render; the scroll only applies after the element mounts. This is intentional (avoids a `useEffect` flash).
- **`hourHeight` defaults to 60** — one pixel per minute. Changing `hourHeight` scales everything (hours, entry heights, scroll offsets) proportionally because all calculations multiply by `hourHeight`.
