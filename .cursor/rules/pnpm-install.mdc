# pnpm Install

When running `pnpm install` (or `pnpm i`), **always** include `--no-frozen-lockfile`:

```bash
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

This allows the lockfile to be updated when package.json has changed (e.g. after adding new dependencies), avoiding `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` failures.
