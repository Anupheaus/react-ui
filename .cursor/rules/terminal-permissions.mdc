# Terminal Command Permissions

When running **read-only** commands that do not modify files or require full system access, use the **minimum required permissions**:

## Read-only commands (no extra permissions or `network` only)

- `npx eslint` / `npm run lint` — linting (no writes)
- `tsc --noEmit` — type checking only
- `npm run build` — when verifying a build (request `all` only if sandbox fails)
- `git status`, `git diff`, `git log` — git read operations
- `jest` / `npm test` — tests (use `network` if tests need it)

## When to request permissions

- **`network`**: Package installs (`npm install`, `pnpm i`), commands that fetch from registry
- **`all`**: Only when the sandbox blocks a read-only command (e.g. build fails with "Cursor Sandbox is unsupported") or when the command genuinely needs full access

Prefer running read-only commands without requesting `all` first; fall back to `all` only if they fail in the sandbox.
