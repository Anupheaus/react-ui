# Agent instructions

When working in this repository, **read the AGENTS.md file at the root of the `@anupheaus/common` package** for information on how to leverage its tools and utilities.

- If the package is installed via the package manager, that file is at **`node_modules/@anupheaus/common/AGENTS.md`**.
- If you are in a monorepo or have the common repo as a sibling, use the root of that repository.

Follow the guidance in that file when using or integrating with `@anupheaus/common` in this codebase.

## Component-specific guidance

- **Windows** (`src/components/Windows/AGENTS.md`): Draggable windows, `useWindow`, `createWindow`, persistence.
- **Dialogs** (`src/components/Dialog/AGENTS.md`): Modal dialogs, `useDialog`, `createDialog`, `useConfirmationDialog`.
